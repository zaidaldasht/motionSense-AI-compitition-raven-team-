Raven Team Project

This repository contains our work as the Raven Team, developed for a competition where the main goal was to train an AI model that can recognize human movements using smartphone sensors.

📂 Model and Data: Available inside the machine_learning folder.

💡 Competition Goal

The competition focused on building an AI model by collecting data from smartphone sensors — accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer — and training it to classify different types of movement, such as:

Walking

Running

Turning right

Turning left

Other movement patterns

🛠️ Technologies Used

Flutter – cross-platform mobile application

WebSocket – real-time communication

Django – backend framework and API services

Machine Learning – custom model for movement detection

🔮 Future Updates

In future versions, we aim to apply this system in real-world scenarios, particularly to assist blind and visually impaired individuals by integrating movement detection with accessibility-focused features.
